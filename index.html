			     Welcome to my first webpage! I am about to exhibit the skills I have acquired through the first week.Join me as I take you through!
			 </p>
			 <p>
			      I was able to apply the skills by doing some projects hence was able to create a few simple  webpages as i will list below.
			 </p>
			 <ul>
			      <li><a href="Happy-Trails-Travel-Agency.html">HAPPY TRAILS TRAVEL AGENCY</a></li>
			 <p>  The webpage is created
			      created using html language and css styling.It showcases packages offered by a travel agency .It alsohas links to hotel suits
			 </p>         


			      <li><a href="Best-Band.html">BEST BAND</a></li>
			      The webpage was build usung css styles ,float and html language.It highlights a christian contemporay band and tickets to ther next tour.
			 </p>     


			      <li><a href="my-first-webpage.html">MY FIRST WEBPAGE</a></li>
			 <p>  The webpage does not 
			      boost of much skills as it was trial of a few command line skills i had learnt.
			 </p>
			 </ul> 

			     <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>

			 <p> 
			      My first college study was at KIM (Kenya Institute of Management ) .I later went ahead to join Daystar University for a dissertation  with a few savings I had made but dropped out later due to financial constraints .I resorted to doing business from which i got a few tenders from schools to supply.Later on Ijoined Riara University to which I was a student untill i deferred my studies to join <a href="<a href=moringaschool.com">MORINGA SCHOOL</a> The idea that informed joining of Moringa was ,after all the struggle to acquire knowledge i ended up being introduced to online writing  which I did part time n I  later  learnt that I could get coding skills which could help me further my agenda as a  self employed Kenyan.I want to code because I need to make contributions to the tech world (most importanly to my county) as well as be part of the solution .
