			      created using html language and css styling.It showcases the beach resorts in tropical area and as well the packages available.

			      boost of much skills as it was trial of a few command line skills i had learnt.

			     <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>

			 <p>  Immediately after my high
			 	  school studies i was able to work for my grandfather as a primary school teacher in his school after which I later worked as a cashier.My first college study was at KIM (Kenya Institute of Management ) .I later went ahead to join Daystar University for a dissertation  with a few savings I had made but dropped out later due to financial constraints .I resorted to doing business from which i got a few tenders from schools to supply.Later on Ijoined Riara University to which I was a student untill i deferred my studies to join <a href="<a href=moringaschool.com">moringa school</a> The idea that informed joining of Moringa was ,after all the struggle to acquire knowledge i ended up being introduced to online jobs as a writer which I did part time n I  later  learnt thati could get coding skills which could help me further agenda as a  self employed Kenyan.
